Explain the code execution based on the order of the messages logged in src/quiz/promise-2darray.txt.

The two calls to sum2DArray() synchronously, one after the other. This initiates the promise in both cases.
Once the method calls are completed, it goes into the respective .then() callback functions where the result
is displayed, if any. If an error is thrown from the Promise, then it is handled in the .catch() of each respective
method. The result is returned after the promises are resolved and no result is returned if the promise is rejected.
